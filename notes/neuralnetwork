Features:
    - no. of bedrooms
    - area
    - the wealth of the neighborhood

We have the dataset (AI Generated).

The number of features is 3, so, we will have 3 neurons in the input layer.
And we will have one hidden layer with 4 neurons, and one neuron in the output layer, which will output the predicted house price.

Now, let's think about the logic:

The Input Layer:
3 Neurons (no computation)
x1 = input feature 1
x2 = input feature 2
x3 = input feature 3

each x[i] is a vector.


The Hidden Layer:
4 Neurons:

the jth neuron:
z[j] = w[1][j].X[1] + w[2][j].X[2] + w[3][j].X[3] + b[j]

Z = W.T * X + B
